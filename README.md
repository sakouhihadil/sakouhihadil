# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hadil Sakouhi

## About Me

I am a passionate Data Scientist Engineer with a strong enthusiasm for Computer Vision. My goal is to leverage data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions.

As a graduate in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I have hands-on experience in developing and deploying end-to-end machine learning projects. From data preprocessing and model development to deployment in production, I enjoy every step of the process.

## Projects

### 1. Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

- Repository: [Image-Classification-CNN](https://github.com/sakouhihadil/Image-Classification-CNN)
- Description: This project demonstrates my skills in building a CNN-based image classifier using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a custom dataset, and I've achieved impressive accuracy on various classes.

### 2. Object Detection with YOLOv5

- Repository: [Object-Detection-YOLOv5](https://github.com/sakouhihadil/Object-Detection-YOLOv5)
- Description: In this project, I explore object detection using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model. I've fine-tuned the model on a custom dataset and applied it to detect objects in real-time using webcams.

### 3. Facial Expression Recognition

- Repository: [Facial-Expression-Recognition](https://github.com/sakouhihadil/Facial-Expression-Recognition)
- Description: This project showcases my work on facial expression recognition using deep learning techniques. The model can identify different facial expressions, such as happy, sad, angry, and more, from images and video streams.
